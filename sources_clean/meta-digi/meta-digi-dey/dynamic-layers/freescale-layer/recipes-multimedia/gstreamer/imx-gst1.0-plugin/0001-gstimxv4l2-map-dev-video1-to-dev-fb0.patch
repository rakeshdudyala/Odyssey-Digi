Subject: [PATCH] gstimxv4l2: map /dev/video1 to /dev/fb0

On the i.MX6UL, the CSI camera is probed before the video PXP device.
In this case the camera is registered as /dev/video0 and the video device
is registered as /dev/video1.

In the mappings for video devices we must map /dev/video1 to /dev/fb0 so
that the imxv4l2sink can work with it.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [DEY specific]
