Subject: [PATCH 4/7] core/device: Prefer bonded bearers when connecting

When attempting to connect a dual-mode device prefer bonded bearer if
only one has been marked as bonded. This prevents connecting to a
different bearer after pairing is complete and cross transport pairing
is not supported.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [DEY specific]
