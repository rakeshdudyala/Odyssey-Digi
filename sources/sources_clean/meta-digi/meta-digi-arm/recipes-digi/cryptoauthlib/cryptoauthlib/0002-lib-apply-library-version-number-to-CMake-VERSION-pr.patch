Subject: [PATCH 2/6] lib: apply library version number to CMake VERSION
 property

This way, CMake will generate a shared library with the version number and an
additional symlink without it. This avoids bitbake errors that appear when
creating *-dev packages, as Yocto development packages should only include
the soname symlinks instead of the actual library file.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [DEY specific]
