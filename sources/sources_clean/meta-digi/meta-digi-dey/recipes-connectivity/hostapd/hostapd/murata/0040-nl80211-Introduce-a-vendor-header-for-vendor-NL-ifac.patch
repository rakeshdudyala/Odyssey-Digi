Subject: [PATCH 40/60] nl80211: Introduce a vendor header for vendor NL iface
 to DRV with OUI_IFX

So far, the proprietary configurations are done either through the private
IOCTL interface or through the vendor nl80211 CMD with OUI_BRCM. For easier
maintainance of the infineon's list of proprietary config interfaces across
DHD, FMAC, wpa_supplicant, hostapd, iw, etc, hereafter start using the new
vendor nl80211 CMD interface with OUI_IFX.

Infineon OUI - 00:03:19 (Ref https://standards-oui.ieee.org/)

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [DEY specific]
