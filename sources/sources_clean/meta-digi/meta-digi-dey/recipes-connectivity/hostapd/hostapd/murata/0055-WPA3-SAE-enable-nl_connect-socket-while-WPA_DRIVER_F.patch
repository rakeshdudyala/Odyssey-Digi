Subject: [PATCH 55/60] WPA3-SAE: enable nl_connect socket while
 WPA_DRIVER_FLAGS_BSS_SELECTION

The driver-base roaming uses WPA_DRIVER_FLAGS_BSS_SELECTION flag.

As the SAE is handled by wpa_supplicant,
the driver will report send_req of auth req frame.

WPA3-CERT 5.8.3 connects to PSK AP first, then roaming to SAE AP.
the nl_connect needs to keep opening to listen the event for process
auth frames.

Fixes: SWLINUX-3420

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [DEY specific]
